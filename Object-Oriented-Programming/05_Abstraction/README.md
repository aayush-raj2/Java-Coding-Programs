# 🧩 Topic: Abstraction, Abstract Classes & Interfaces in Java

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how **Abstraction** hides internal implementation and shows only essential functionality to users — achieved through **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces**.

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Abstraction** | Hiding internal implementation details and exposing only essential behavior. |
| **Abstract Class** | Declared using `abstract` keyword; can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. |
| **Interface** | Achieves 100% abstraction; contains only method declarations (until Java 8 added default/static methods). |
| **Abstract Method** | Declared without implementation; must be overridden in subclasses. |
| **Marker Interface** | Empty interface (no methods) used to signal metadata (e.g., `Serializable`, `Cloneable`). |

## ⚙️ How Abstraction Works

Abstraction focuses on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.  
Example: When you press *start* on a washing machine, you don’t care about the motor logic — only that it washes clothes.

---

## 🧱 Abstract Class Rules

1. Must be declared with the `abstract` keyword.  
2. Cannot be instantiated directly.  
3. Can include constructors, static methods, and data members.  
4. Subclasses must override all abstract methods unless they are abstract themselves.  
5. Can mix abstract and concrete (implemented) methods.

---

## 💡 Interface Rules

- Declared using the `interface` keyword.  
- Supports **multiple inheritance**.  
- Cannot have constructors.  
- All variables are implicitly `public static final`.  
- All methods are implicitly `public abstract`, except:
  - `default` methods (Java 8+)
  - `static` methods (Java 8+)
  - `private` methods (Java 9+)

## ⚖️ Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Keyword** | `abstract` | `interface` |
| **Methods** | Abstract + Non-abstract | Abstract (and default/static since Java 8) |
| **Variables** | Any type | Always `public static final` |
| **Constructors** | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Not allowed |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | ❌ Not allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| **Purpose** | Code reusability | Abstraction + contract enforcement |

## 💥 The Diamond Problem (in Interfaces)

### 🧩 What is it?
Occurs when a class implements **multiple interfaces** containing the **same default method**.  
The compiler cannot decide which method to inherit — leading to ambiguity.

### ⚙️ How Java Solves It
Java avoids the Diamond Problem by forcing the implementing class to **override** the conflicting method and explicitly call the desired interface’s method using:

```java
InterfaceName.super.methodName();
```

# ✅ Takeaway

- No ambiguity at runtime.
- Full control over which interface’s method executes.
- Prevents classic multiple inheritance conflicts found in C++.

## 💥 Marker Interfaces

| Interface      | Purpose                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Serializable` | Marks object as eligible for serialization.    |
| `Cloneable`    | Enables cloning using `Object.clone()` method. |
| `Remote`       | Used in Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation).   |

## 🌟 Summary

Abstraction simplifies complexity by focusing on what the system does, not how it does it.
Through abstract classes and interfaces, Java achieves flexible, modular, and scalable code —
while ensuring safety, reusability, and clear separation of concerns.
> ✨ “Abstraction turns complexity into clarity — the mark of professional software design.” ✨
