## 🧭 Overview  

This repository serves as a structured guide to **understanding OOP in Java**, covering the 5 main principles:  
1. **Class & Object**  
2. **Constructor & Destructor (Garbage Collection)**  
3. **Inheritance**  
4. **Polymorphism**  
5. **Abstraction & Encapsulation**

Each folder contains well-documented programs, notes, and outputs to help you learn both **theory and implementation**.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Concept            | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class & Object** | Core structure of Java OOP, defining behavior and attributes.               |
| **Constructor**    | Special methods used to initialize objects.                                 |
| **Inheritance**    | Enables reusability and hierarchical relationships.                         |
| **Polymorphism**   | Allows same method name to behave differently.                              |
| **Abstraction**    | Hiding internal implementation using abstract classes and interfaces.       |
| **Encapsulation**  | Restricting direct access to data using private fields and getters/setters. |
