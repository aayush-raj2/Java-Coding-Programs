# 🧩 Topic: Benefits of OOP

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the three key benefits of Object-Oriented Programming:
**Reusability**, **Security**, and **Extensibility**.

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Reusability | Use existing code in new contexts (via inheritance/composition) |
| Security (Encapsulation) | Protect data by hiding internal details |
| Extensibility | Add new functionality without changing existing code |

---

## 💡 Why Important
These principles make OOP powerful for:
- 📦 Scalable application design  
- 🧩 Code modularity and reusability  
- 🔒 Safe data handling  
- ⚙️ Future-proof software architecture

## 📂 Files Included
| File | Concept Demonstrated |
|------|----------------------|
| `ReusabilityExample.java` | Inheritance and code reuse |
| `SecurityExample.java` | Encapsulation and data protection |
| `ExtensibilityExample.java` | Open/Closed principle with abstract classes |

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
✅ Reuse existing code instead of rewriting it  
✅ Secure sensitive data using encapsulation  
✅ Extend features easily without breaking existing code  
✅ Follow OOP principles for clean, maintainable design
