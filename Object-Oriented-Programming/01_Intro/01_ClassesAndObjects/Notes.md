# 🧱 Topic: Classes and Objects

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how **classes** define structure and **objects** bring those structures to life.

---

## 📘 Key Points
- **Class** → Blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object** → Instance of a class.
- **Constructor** → Initializes object attributes.
- **Each object** has its own independent state.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Analogy
| Real Life | Java |
|------------|-------|
| Blueprint | Class |
| Actual Building | Object |
| Design defines rooms, colors | Class defines data & methods |

---

## 📂 Files Included
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `ClassExample.java` | Defines class structure |
| `ObjectDemo.java` | Creates and uses objects |
| `ObjectBehaviorExample.java` | Shows independent object behavior |

---
## 🧠 Takeaways

> ✅ Class = Blueprint

> ✅ Object = Real-world instance

> ✅ Each object has its own data

> ✅ Constructor initializes attributes

> ✅ Actions on one object don’t affect another
