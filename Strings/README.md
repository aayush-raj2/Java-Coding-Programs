# 💬 Java Strings — Concept Introduction

This folder contains Java programs and notes demonstrating **String fundamentals**, including creation, immutability, escape sequences, input handling, arrays, methods, and exception handling.

---

## 🧠 Overview

In Java, a **String** is an *immutable object* representing a sequence of characters.  
Unlike primitive types, strings are **reference types** stored in **heap memory**.  
They support powerful operations like concatenation, comparison, and formatting.

## 📚 Topics Covered

| Part | Concept | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Understanding Java Strings** | Immutability, string pool, reference types, and memory model. |
| 2 | **Creating Strings** | Using literals, `new` keyword, character arrays, and `StringBuilder`. |
| 3 | **Escape Sequences** | Special characters like `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, and Unicode escapes. |
| 4 | **String Input** | Taking user input with `Scanner` and `BufferedReader`. |
| 5 | **String Arrays** | Initializing, iterating, sorting, and handling exceptions in arrays. |
| 6 | **Strings as Method Parameters** | Passing strings, immutability in methods, and using `StringBuilder`. |
| 7 | **Exception Handling** | Handling runtime and checked exceptions in string programs. |
