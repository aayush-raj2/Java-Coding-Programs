# 🚶 Queue — Linear Data Structure

## 🎯 Concept
Queue follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** — the first inserted element is removed first.

---

## ⚙️ Core Operations

| Operation | Description | Time Complexity |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `enqueue()` | Add element to rear | O(1) |
| `dequeue()` | Remove element from front | O(1) |
| `peek()` | View front element | O(1) |
| `isEmpty()` | Check if queue is empty | O(1) |

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogies
- People waiting in line at a counter.  
- Printer job queue.  
- CPU process scheduling.

---

## 🧩 Variants
- **Circular Queue** – Reuses space efficiently.  
- **Priority Queue** – Serves elements based on importance, not arrival.  

---

## 🧠 Applications
- Process scheduling  
- Call center routing  
- IO buffering  
- Message queues
