# 🧱 Linear Data Structures — Stack & Queue in Java

### 👨‍💻 Author: **Aayush Raj**

This module introduces **Linear Data Structures**, focusing on **Stack (LIFO)** and **Queue (FIFO)** implementations,  
their **real-world applications**, and **Java-based examples** inspired by memory and scheduling systems.

## 📘 Topics Covered

| No. | Folder | Concept | Description |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | `01_Stack` | Stack | Last-In-First-Out structure used for Undo, Backtracking, and Expression Evaluation |
| 2️⃣ | `02_Queue` | Queue | First-In-First-Out structure used for Scheduling, Buffers, and Messaging Systems |

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
✔ Understand core stack & queue operations.  
✔ Implement array-based structures manually.  
✔ Apply them to solve real-world and algorithmic problems.  
✔ Recognize overflow and underflow conditions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Stack (LIFO):** Last element added is the first removed.  
- **Queue (FIFO):** First element added is the first removed.  
- **Priority Queue:** Items served based on assigned priority.  
- **Circular Queue:** Reuses space efficiently using modular arithmetic.
