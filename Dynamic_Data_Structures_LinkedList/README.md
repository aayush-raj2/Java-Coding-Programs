# 🔗 Dynamic Data Structures — Linked List Implementation and Operations

### 👨‍💻 Author: **Aayush Raj**

This module explores **Linked Lists in Java**, a fundamental dynamic data structure that provides efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.  
It covers **Singly**, **Doubly**, and **Circular Linked Lists**, implemented manually for clarity and understanding.

## 📘 Topics Covered

| No. | Concept | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | Singly Linked List | Unidirectional structure linking each node to the next |
| 2️⃣ | Doubly Linked List | Bidirectional links between previous and next nodes |
| 3️⃣ | Circular Linked List | Last node points to the head, forming a circular structure |

---

## ⚙️ Key Operations
- `insert()` → Add node at head/end/position  
- `delete()` → Remove node from list  
- `display()` → Traverse and print list elements

## 🧠 Why Linked List?
| Feature | Linked List | Array |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Memory Allocation | Dynamic | Static |
| Insertion/Deletion | Easier | Harder |
| Random Access | Slower | Faster |
| Space Efficiency | Better for unknown size | Needs predefined size |

✔ Understand node-based dynamic memory management  
✔ Implement various Linked List types manually  
✔ Recognize real-world applications and efficiency trade-offs
