# 📘 Linked List — Concept Notes

## 🔍 Definition
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure made of nodes where each node holds:
- **Data** (value)
- **Reference** (pointer) to the next node.

Unlike arrays, elements are not stored contiguously in memory.

## 🧩 Types of Linked Lists
| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Singly Linked List (SLL)** | Each node points to the next node. |
| **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** | Each node has pointers to both previous and next nodes. |
| **Circular Linked List (CLL)** | Last node points back to the first node. |

## 💡 Real-Life Analogies
- **Train coaches** — each connected to the next (SLL)
- **Browser forward/back buttons** — move in both directions (DLL)
- **Round-robin scheduling** — continuous looping (CLL)

---

## ⚙️ Common Operations
- **Insert at beginning/end/specific position**
- **Delete node**
- **Traverse (Display all elements)**

---

## 🧠 Advantages
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertions/deletions
- No memory waste

## ⚠️ Disadvantages
- More memory overhead (pointers)
- Sequential access only
- Difficult reverse traversal (SLL)
