# 📊 UML Diagrams in Java — Advanced OOP

### 👨‍💻 Author: **Aayush Raj**

This section explains **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** — the visual foundation of software design.  
You’ll learn how to represent class relationships, runtime objects, and method interactions using **Class, Object, and Sequence diagrams** — demonstrated with an **Online Shopping System** example.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Visualize system architecture before coding.  
- Understand class relationships (association, composition).  
- Model runtime instances and method call sequences.  

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

| File | Concept | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `ClassDiagramDemo.java` | Class Diagram | Static structure of system classes |
| `ObjectDiagramDemo.java` | Object Diagram | Runtime snapshot of object instances |
| `SequenceDiagramDemo.java` | Sequence Diagram | Step-by-step flow of messages between objects |
| `UML_Basics.md` | Notes | Theory, comparisons, and key points |

## 🧩 Real-World Example
🛍️ **Online Shopping System** — Customers browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders.  
Used across all three UML representations to connect design to code.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
✅ UML bridges design and implementation.  
✅ Improves communication between developers and stakeholders.  
✅ Enhances maintainability and scalability of systems.
